<h1>Sausage meatballs with chickpeas</h1>

<p>This a "paleo" take on the classic spaghetti and meatballs dish by replacing the noodles with chickpeas for added protein. Good dinner choice for body-builders</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>700g pork and fennel sausages (or other pork sausages)</li>
<li>2 tbs extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, whole, crushed with knife</li>
<li>400g can chickpeas, rinsed and drained</li>
<li>400g can Ardmona Diced Tomatoes</li>
<li>2 tbs tomato paste</li>
<li>1⁄2 cup (125ml) red wine</li>
<li>Grated parmesan to serve</li>
<li>Mixed salad leaves to serve</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>Remove sausages from their casings. Season with pepper and then form into meatballs using about 11⁄2 tbs mixture.</li>
<li>Heat oil in a large, heavy-based pan. Add the meatballs and cook, turning, for 4-5 minutes until golden. Add the garlic and cook, tossing to coat, for 1 minute.</li>
